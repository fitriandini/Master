Projects in Master of Information Security Technology - TU/eindhoven

Project: Financial Consultant. 
This is just a small demonstration project to implement the design of Search in Encrypted Data. 
In this project, the private key and the public key of server, consultant and client are stored unencryted 
in the same folder as the project.
As in the real implementation, one might consider to enrypt and secure those. 
In this project, the implementation of the authentication procedure is also done in one class, 
while one might consider to separate the process between the client and the server.

The main class is Login.java (in gui package) and after choose the user credential (either client or consultant), 
user can run the other features.
